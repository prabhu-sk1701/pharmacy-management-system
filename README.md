# pharmacy-management-system
A Desktop GUI app on Pharmacy Management System

This is a project created by Pranav Patki (1911038) and Shubham Prabhu (1911040) as part of OSTPL Mini project.

How to run the program:
1) Clone the repo onto your local system
2) Run the main.py file.
3) The GUI app will now be running

#### NOTE ####

The patient registration window and hospital mangement windows are incorporated inside the main file itself.
However, for better understanding of code we have created separate files for the same.
registration.py holds the code for patient registration window.
hospital.py holds the code for hospital management window.
schemaDatabase.txt holds the SQL queries and schema for the entire project.
Also make sure you have mySQLdb installed on the system.
